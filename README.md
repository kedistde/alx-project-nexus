ALX Project Nexus - E-Commerce Backend Documentation

Overview

This repository documents my implementation of the E-Commerce Backend project for the ProDev Backend Engineering program. The project simulates a real-world e-commerce backend system with a focus on scalability, security, and performance.

🛍️ E-Commerce Backend Project

Project Goals

· CRUD APIs: Build APIs for managing products, categories, and user authentication
· Filtering, Sorting, Pagination: Implement robust logic for efficient product discovery
· Database Optimization: Design a high-performance database schema to support seamless queries

Technologies Used

· Django: For building a scalable backend framework
· PostgreSQL: As the relational database for optimized performance
· JWT: For secure user authentication
· Swagger/OpenAPI: To document and test APIs

🚀 Implementation Details

Key Features Implemented

1. CRUD Operations

· Create, read, update, and delete operations for products and categories
· User authentication and management features using JWT
· Secure password handling with hashing and salting

2. API Features

· Filtering and Sorting: Users can filter products by category, price range, availability, and sort by price, name, or date added
· Pagination: Implemented cursor-based pagination for efficient handling of large product datasets
· Search Functionality: Full-text search across product names and descriptions

3. API Documentation

· Integrated Swagger/OpenAPI for automatic API documentation
· Published hosted API docs at /api/docs/ endpoint
· Comprehensive examples and testing interface for frontend developers

Database Schema Design

```python
# Simplified schema representation
class Category(models.Model):
    name = models.CharField(max_length=100)
    description = models.TextField()
    slug = models.SlugField(unique=True)

class Product(models.Model):
    name = models.CharField(max_length=200)
    description = models.TextField()
    price = models.DecimalField(max_digits=10, decimal_places=2)
    category = models.ForeignKey(Category, on_delete=models.CASCADE)
    stock = models.IntegerField(default=0)
    created_at = models.DateTimeField(auto_now_add=True)
    updated_at = models.DateTimeField(auto_now=True)
    
class User(AbstractUser):
    email = models.EmailField(unique=True)
    # Additional custom fields as needed
```

API Endpoints
